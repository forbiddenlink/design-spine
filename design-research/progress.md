# Upgrade progress

Branch: `design/upgrade`. Main and production untouched. User confirmed this scope is Design Spine itself, including continued product improvement.

## Phase 1 — complete

Repository and product template mapped in profile.md. Genuine fixture capture isolated inside design-research; existing example data not read. Review, viewer, and empty states captured at desktop/mobile widths. Demo pages are diagnostic fixtures and will remain unchanged.

## Phase 2 — in progress

Research galleries and live peer pages in real Playwright. Gallery inclusion and award status must be verified, never inferred. Persist raw loaded-page evidence and screenshots. Record blocks explicitly.

## Remaining

3. Freeze direction and ranked feature scope.
4. Foundation plus two homepage screenshot/score/fix rounds.
5. Viewer, empty, loading, error, save-success/failure states, every template.
6. Typecheck, lint, tests, browser journeys, Lighthouse.
7. Report with before/after and limitations; stop without merge.

## Local services and resume

Demo fixture localhost:14010; review localhost:14747. Start fixture with `bun fixtures/demo-site/serve.ts 14010`; review with `bun src/cli.ts review --run design-research/.design-spine/latest --port 14747`. Browser launch and local listeners need sandbox escalation. Initial sandbox attempts failed; dedicated escalated fixture works. Only review fixture data. Untracked examples/testimoniq/.design-spine remains untouched.
